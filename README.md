# GredientDescendSample

This code is the sample of gredient descend. 
The objective function is y=2 * (x1) + (x2) + 3. So we try to predict variable a,b and c from function y=a * (x1) + b*(x2) + c.
The loss function I use is "squared error loss" which is one of the most widely used loss functions.
